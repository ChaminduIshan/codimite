# How to automate the process using TFActions.
1. Setting triggers action like code push/pulls, scheduled times, and manual events to initiate the automation.

2. Mention the step-by-step that the workflow works. Those steps can be testing, building applications, deploying source code, and executing scripts.

3. Configure/Write Action Scripts 
    Input: mentioning parameters and variables that the script uses like environment variables, and secrets.
    Running Commands: every action requires you to run commands, scripts, or commands in a special environment.
    Output Handling: Monitor and log all execution results, output for analysis or further action,

4. Integrating TFActions with Terraform. TFActions can be directly linked to Terraform. If common use cases:
    Terraform Initialization: initializing a configuration to Automate the running of terraform init.
    Terraform Plan: Automate the terraform plan to review the changes that will be made to the infrastructure.
    Terraform Apply: After approval, run Terraform Apply and the infrastructure will be automatically changed.

5. Configure Outputs and Notifications
    Output Automation: Set up workflows to automatically manageTerraform output, logging, notifications, and reports to dashboards
    Notifications: Use actions to notify team members of the success or failure of the process via email or other third-party systems.

# secure the setup.

1.	VPC Isolation: Custom VPC can provide network isolation, It is possible to ensure that access to different subnets is controlled. Using a private subnet for        CloudSQL and Redis can ensure that these resources are not publicly accessible.

2.	Using private IP for CloudSQL: By using private IP addresses instead of public IPs for CloudSQL, CloudSQL cannot be accessed directly over the internet.

3.	Firewall Rules: Restrict access between different components by setting firewall rules. Not exposing GKE node, CloudSQL, and Redis to the public internet and       allowing communication between these services only through internal IPs

4.	Using private GKE Endpoint: Even if the GKE cluster is not directly exposed to the internet, use an Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) to provide internal access to       the GKE control plane if needed via a Load Balancer or VPN.

5.	Using VPC Peering: Gain access to other projects using VPC Peering with appropriate firewall rules to control which services can communicate.

6.	Using Data Encryption: We need to check if the data is encrypted at rest and in transit. Google Cloud automatically encrypts data at rest, but we need to make      sure that services like Redis and CloudSQL encrypt data in transit.

# Optimize Costs while Maintaining High Availability

1.	autoscaling for GKE: Enables the GKE cluster to automatically scale up or down based on workload. This can optimize costs by using only the resources needed.

2.	CloudSQL High Availability: Using CloudSQL in a high availability configuration with both minimal downtime and automatic failover.

3.	Cost Management: Track spending and avoid unexpected expenses using Google Cloud's budgets and alerts tools. 

#Thurd

# How to configure the deployment through ArgoCD

1.	First Install ArgoCD on the GKE cluster.
2.	Connect to the Git Repository with Kubernetes Manifests: Create the environment for GitOps access by storing Kubernetes manifests in a Git repository. ArgoCD       will monitor the Git repository and synchronize the required state to the cluster.
3.	use an existing one that contains Kubernetes YAML files or Create a Git repository
4.	 need the repository to contain a Deployment.yaml or similar manifest for the application.
5.	after ArgoCD is installed and the Kubernetes manifests in the Git repository, need to create an ArgoCD application that links the Git repository to the GKE         cluster.
6.	we can create the ArgoCD application using the ArgoCD UI,  Kubernetes manifest, or as a CLI.
7.	Application is created, and ArgoCD shows the application status  "Synced". 
8.	This synchronization can be automated by push the Docker image to GCR and adding a sync step to the GitHub Actions pipeline.
9.	After building and pushing the Docker image, the GitHub Actions workflow triggers a sync for the microservice via the ArgoCD application, ensuring that the new     image is deployed to GKE based on the latest commit.

# Approach to troubleshooting the issue

1. Investigate Logs and Metrics 
    Check GKE Pod Logs, CloudSQL Logs, Network connectivity, and traffic Network  Monitoring 
2. Investigate Networking Configuration
    Check VPC Peering,  IP connectivity, port connectivity, and Firewall Rules are fine
3. Investigate the system how to use Resource 
    check Pod resource, CloudSQL resource, and network resource 
4. Isolate the issue, apply necessary things, and test system working fine 

#  Tools and steps would be used to resolve the network timeout and prevent future occurrences.

1. Configure network settings again
    If the issue is related to VPC, DNS, or firewall misconfigurations, fix the configuration and check communication between GKE pods and CloudSQL.
2.CloudSQL Resources are increasing: like increasing CPU, memory, or storage capacity to handle the load and scale up the instance and its settings as needed.
3. Pod resource limits are optimized: check the application pods have good CPU and memory limits and are not being crashed or killed.
4. Check connectivity (for testing purposes): After adding changes, ensure that the pods connect to CloudSQL without timeouts.

   As long-term solutions to prevent relapse: For database connections, we can use connection pooling in an application. Set up Monitor and Alerting tools like        Grapana, Nagios, and Zabbix. Database Connection Limits are increased, done some load testing, and check system logs
